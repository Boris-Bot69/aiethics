            <h4>4. Matomo (Webtracking)</h4>
            <p>On our website, with your consent, the data is collected and used by a web analysis service software Matomo (www.matomo.org), a service provided by InnoCraft Ltd., 7 Waterloo Quay PO625, 6140 Wellington, New Zealand, (“Matomo”).

            <h4>5. Google Maps</h4>
            <p>Some of the pages on our website use Google Maps API, a map service operated by Google LLC (“Google”). Google can be reached at Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). This enables us to show you interactive maps directly on the website and to offer you convenient use of the map function.</p>
            <p>When you visit the respective page of our website on which the map services are offered, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage. In addition, the following data is transmitted to Google: your IP-Adresse; date and time of the request; content of the request (specific page); information about your location; Website from which the request came; your browser type; your operating system and its interface; The language setting and version of the browser software.</p>
            <p>This happens regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you are logged into, or whether there is no user account. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. Google stores your data as a usage profile and uses it for advertising, market research and / or needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide need-based, customer-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the Google network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, although you must contact Google directly to exercise this right.</p>
            <p>In this processing, our cooperation with Google takes place on the basis of an agreement on joint responsibility in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR. You can find the agreement under the following link: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/intl/de/businesses/mapscontrollerterms/" target="_blank">https://privacy.google.com/intl/de/businesses/mapscontrollerterms/</a>.</p>
            <p>You have the option of simply deactivating the Google Maps service and thus preventing data transfer to Google: To do this, deactivate JavaScript in your browser. However, we would like to point out that in this case you will not be able to use the map display. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and relies on the so-called standard contractual clauses of the European Commission, further information can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=de" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=de</a>.</p>
            <p>We use Google Maps API to be able to offer you a map function. A justification is given in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter a) GDPR, provided that your consent was received in advance. You can revoke this at any time with effect for the future. In this case, you can no longer use the Google Maps service. Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by Google can be found in Google’s data protection declaration: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>.</p>

            <h4>6. Integrated Video and Audio Services</h4>
            <p><strong>a. Youtube-Plugins (Videos):</strong> Our website has integrated plugins from www.youtube.com, which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”). We use embedded YouTube videos in the extended data protection mode. YouTube describes how it works as follows: “With the extended data protection mode, you can embed YouTube videos without cookies being set to analyze usage behavior. Therefore no data on user activities is collected in order to personalize the video playback. Instead, video recommendations are based on the current video. Videos that are played in the extended data protection mode do not affect which videos are recommended to a user on YouTube ”. Cookies are only set by YouTube if you actively activate the playback of an embedded video. Further information is available at <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en</a>.</p>
            <p>If you call up pages on our website that have a YouTube plug-in, a connection to the YouTube servers is established and the plug-in is displayed on the website by a message to your browser. This will transmit to the YouTube server within our websites which you have previously visited. If you are logged in as a member of YouTube, YouTube will assign this information to your personal user accounts on these platforms. When using these plugins, such as clicking / start buttons on a video or sending a comment, this information is assigned to your e.g. YouTube user account, which you can only prevent by logging out before using the plugin.</p>

            <p><strong>b. Vimeo:</strong> We use the provider Vimeo, operated by Vimeo, Inc., 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011 (“vimeo”) to integrate videos into our website. If you call up videos via vimeo on our website, a connection to the vimeo servers in the USA is established. As a result, certain information is transmitted to vimeo, regardless of whether you have a vimeo account or not. This can be: your IP address; your browser information; cookie information about vimeo cookies that have already been set; information about the website from which you access vimeos.</p>
            <p>Vimeo stores cookies on your device. In particular, the Google Analytics tracker. This is vimeo’s own tracking, to which we have no access. You can prevent tracking by Google Analytics by using the deactivation tools that Google offers: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</p>

            <h2>C. Information on Individual Processing</h2>
            <h3>I. Newsletter</h3>
            <p>If you register for one of our newsletters with your e-mail address, we will only use your e-mail address to send our newsletter. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link provided in the newsletter. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after your registration we will send you an e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration, your information will be automatically deleted after one month. After your confirmation, we will save your email address and other information for the purpose of sending you the newsletter (Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter a) GDPR). In addition, we save the IP addresses you used and the times of registration and confirmation (Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter f) GDPR).</p>
            <p>The e-mail addresses for sending are stored on the MailPoet newsletter server, a WordPress plug-in, and are not used for any purposes other than sending the newsletter. The newsletter subscribers can cancel their subscription themselves at any time.</p>

            <h3>2. Virtual and Physical Events</h3>
            <p>You can register for our events on the IEAI website with your last name, first name and email address. For this purpose, a list for the respective event is created in MailPoet. An email with the Zoom LogIn data and information about the venue will be sent to this list before the event. After the event, this list and thus the data of the participants will be deleted again.</p>
            <p>The events are recorded via zoom in order to publish them on our website. Speakers and the IEAI staff can be seen during the event and within the recording. Participants and names of the participants cannot be seen. After the lecture, the participants have the opportunity to ask their questions in the zoom chat and an IEAI employee will pass on the questions only to the relevant speaker. The names of the questioners are not mentioned here. The recordings are saved on our IEAI folder on the NAS drive (LRZ - Leibnitz Rechenzentrum).</p>
            <p>The e-mail addresses for sending the Zoom links are stored on the MailPoet server and are deleted by our institute no later than 4 weeks after the respective event.</p>
